Around ten years ago, I began to watch tons of anime, one of them being TWGOK (The World God Only Knows, in Japan it is called *Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai*), I have completed watching the series until end of season.

The anime focused on main character, *Katsuragi Keima*, an ordinary Japanese High School boy reading who loves to play game, he like to play dating sim game in a *PFP* which appear to be a PSP (PlayStation Portable) knock off, one day he encounters a demon in a teenage girl form called Elsie. He then by accident forms a contract with Elsie to recapture evil spirit on the loose, this so called evil spirit will posses a girls to hidden themselves in the girl heart.

To capture them, Keima must capture the girls hearts (romantically), usually the process will ends with Keima kissing the girls, and then there will be an evil spirit that hurriedly leaves the girls bodyâ€”this evil spirit will be captured in a jar by Elsie. The girls then will forget this 'incident' with Keima and goes on with their lives.

I remember I binge watched this like 8-10 years ago in my room, I only found out that this anime is based on manga that have way more content and story, you can see the explanation on [TWGOK Manga vs Anime](https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/4741). Now, being a more manga reader than anime watcher, I decided to revisit this legendary anime again (in form of manga)
