Hello, it's my first time writing in Zola SSG, I hope I can continue this habit.

Like I said, I decided to write more frequently now, because I remember my grandpa once said "Instead of remembering something, you'll better off write that 'something', because it will last longer (and possibly others will find it helpful) than just simply remembering", I have to say that's a really good advice.

So from now on, I'm trying to write, when I don't writeâ€”that mean I stopped thinking, society died when one stops thinking.

Cheers !
